    <h2 id="hey">Hey There!</h2>
    
    <p class="bio-p">My name's Ian. I'm currently attending Code Fellows Tech Academy, and before this I was in sales at a concrete company (super exciting stuff, I know). Before working at the concrete company I had all kinds of jobs; I was a fraud investigator at Amazon, and English teacher in China, a waiter, a cook and even a wildland firefighter at one point. I grew up in Eugene, Oregon, and moved to China after I graduated from college, and after that I ended up in Seattle. I'm a big fan of the outdoors and all kinds of sports. My favorites are basketball, snowboarding, skateboarding, ultimate frisbee & disc golf. I also found while remodeling my house that I love carpentry and woodworking! I love fantasy and sci-fi too.</p>
    <p class="bio-p">I'm looking forward to building my skill set during this boot camp, so that I can get a job that will give me a better life, and hopefully I'll be able to use those skills to do some good in this world!</p>
