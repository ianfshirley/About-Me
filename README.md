## About Me

I've built an 'About Me' page, with a little bio about myself, a brief history of my work experience and education. The page also asks the user several questions about me, and they will try to guess the correct answers.
The responses the user gets will depend on their answers to the prompts/questions.

Today, I'm adding a bit more CSS styling, and adding 2 more questions with some more complex JS code, using arrays, loops and conditional statements.
